While there are tools available to help improve accessibility, they often provide a skewed view of what is truly needed. It requires a fundamental shift in the organization's mindset. In this talk, Lucien will not only cover some of the available tools but also what is needed to create a culture of accessibility within your team and organization, ensuring your software is genuinely usable by everyone.\n\nDigital accessibility goes beyond implementing tools. It demands a holistic approach that encompasses all aspects of development and design. This means considering accessibility from the very beginning and integrating it into every phase of the development process. By embracing a new mindset, you can ensure your software not only meets legal requirements but is truly accessible to all users.\n\nIn this session, Lucien will discuss the key principles and strategies to enhance digital accessibility. He will discuss what you can do to create a culture of accessibility within your organization and the steps you can take to achieve this.

Some teams have complete control over their user interfaces (UI), while others navigate the intricate dance between front-end and back-end developers. But why does collaboration remain an elusive goal? Shouldnâ€™t it be simpler?\n\nImagine this: treating UI components as if they were APIs. Just as we meticulously design APIs before diving into implementation, letâ€™s apply the same principle to components. Picture this: complex componentsâ€”think interactive maps, ordering systems, and payment optionsâ€”encased in a black-box with a well-defined API. Now take it a step further. Extend this approach to both back-end and front-end frameworks. The result? A harmonious symphony of development, where seamless collaboration becomes the norm.\n\nSo, letâ€™s embrace the power of design-first thinking. Letâ€™s redefine how we build, share, and collaborate. Because when components come with their APIs preordained, magic happens!",2,"3",{"id":24,"data":26,"filePath":17},{"title":27,"description":28,"sessionID":29},"Why LIT is ðŸ”¥","Every day a new JavaScript library is born, every week a new framework arrives and every month a front-end developer needs to rewrite a date picker ðŸ˜¢\nLIT is a modern library for creating component libraries, design systems but also sites and apps.\nLIT components are web components and as such work anywhere you use HTML.\n\nIn this talk Lucien will show what makes LIT be on fire!
